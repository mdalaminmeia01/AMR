This repository presents a path planning framework for an Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) designed to support smooth, continuous, and safe navigation in structured and semi-structured environments. The approach focuses on generating feasible motion trajectories while respecting kinematic constraints, obstacle avoidance, and system safety requirements.

All path planning figures and visualizations included in this project were generated programmatically using Python, ensuring high resolution.
